# Create mirror for StarlingX

## Step 0 - Build the container

Build the docker image on your Linux host (with Docker supported). **NOTE**: if necessary you might have to set http/https proxy in your Dockerfile before building the docker image below.

```
$ docker build -t <your_docker_image_name>:<your_image_version> -f Dockerfile .
```

## Step 1 - Run the container

The container shall be run from the same directory where the other scripts are stored.

```
$ docker run -it -v $(pwd):/localdisk <your_docker_image_name>:<your_image_version> bash
```

As `/localdisk` is defined as the workdir of the container, the same folder name should be used to define the volume. The container will start to run and populate a `logs` and `output` folders in this directory.
The container shall be run from the same directory where the other scripts are stored.

## step 2 - Run the `download_mirror.sh` script

Once inside the container run the downloader script

```
$ ./download_mirror.sh
```

NOTE: in case there are some downloading failures due to network instability (or timeout),
you should download them manually, to assure you get all RPMs listed in "rpms_from_3rd_parties.lst" and "rpms_from_centos_repo.lst".

## step 3 - Copy the files to the mirror

After all downloading complete, copy the download files to mirror.

```
$ find ./output -name "*.i686.rpm" | xargs rm -f
$ chown  751:751 -R ./output
$ cp -rf  output/stx-r1/ <your_mirror_folder>/
```

In this case `<your_mirror_folder>` can be whatever folder you want to use as mirror.

## step 4 - Tweaks in the StarlingX build system.

NOTE: step below is not needed if you've synced the latest codebase.

Go into StarlingX build system (*another* container which hosts cgcs build system), and follow up below steps:

## Debugging issues

The `download_mirror.sh` script will create log files in the form of `centos_rpms_*.txt`. After the download is complete, it's recommended to check the content of these files to see if everything was downloaded correctly.

A quick look into these files could be:

```
$ cd output/
$ cat *missing*
```

In this case, there shoudn't be any package in the "missing" files.
